# Facial-Landmark-detection
Detection of Facial Landmarks with the use of dlib, OpenCV and python

## Prerequist Libraries
- dlib
- OpenCV 2
- python and its libraries

## How it works?
Detecting facial landmarks is a subset of the shape prediction problem. Given an input image (and normally an ROI that specifies the object of interest), a shape predictor attempts to localize key points of interest along the shape.

The pre-trained facial landmark detector inside the dlib library is used to estimate the location of 68 (x, y)-coordinates that map to facial structures on the face.
